# Blackjack

A classic casino game brought to you in your browser to enjoy from the comfort of home.
The goal of this game is to get a hand of higher value than the dealer without going over 21. If at any point in the hand the player or dealer go over 21 they have 'busted' and lose the hand.
Cards are worth the number stated on them, with face cards being worth 10 and aces being worth 11 or 1 (whichever is most beneficial to the player).
Winning a hand will pay the player 2X what they bet ($10 bet will yield a total of $20 payout) unless they get a blackjack (21 hand value from the opening deal) in that case the player gets a 3:2 payout (betting $10 will yield a $25 payout). A tie with the dealer will return the player's bet amount to them and the hand is considered a 'push'. 
The game is considered lost when the player runs out of money to play with.
